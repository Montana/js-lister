# js-lister

Script I created to list all JS elements/files on a site in the DevConsole. 2/10/2024.

## Usage

If you're using Chrome go to your developer tab and click `View -> Developer -> JavaScript Console` and paste my script in the DevConsole. You may have to type `allow` first, then try and copy the script into the DevConsole again.

Once you execute it, you should start seeing results looking something similar to this:
